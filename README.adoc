# SAML conformance profiles
## Objective
Modernize the SAML profiles to be used in higher education, e-Government and industry with a focus on WebSSO.
Taking the input from the InCommon Federation Interoperability WG a new profile has been created, extending existing ones:

- Kantara Initiative eGovernment Implementation Profile of SAML V2.0
- SAML2int v0.2.1 (SAML 2.0 Interoperability Deployment Profile)

The intention of this effort is to support the update of these profiles, including operation experience accumulated since the publication of above profiles, and providing more formal references to requirements, which in turn can be used by test and conformance evaluation tools.

## Contents

- SAML V2.0 Implementation Profile for Federation Interoperability [FedIopProfile]
  Updated recommendation  to replace the Kantara eGov Implementation Profile
  https://kantarainitiative.github.io/SAMLprofiles/fedinterop.html[draft document]
  https://kantarainitiative.github.io/SAMLprofiles/egov-profile-diff.html[differences to eGov profile]
- Kantara eGov Implementation Profile SAML2.0 (V2.0bis)
  This document is a transformation of the document from 11 June 2011 into the Asciidoc format. With the intention to keep the essential contents, the format was changed to make it comparable to the newer FedIopProfile.

## View resulting documents

## Tooling
Document parts in the repository are written in Asciidoc. The recommended toolchain is:
- Create a fork of the system or get access to the upstream repo
- Clone the master branch of repository to your local system
- Edit documents with your favourite text editor
- checkout the gh-pages branch into a second directory, e.g. this way:

  git worktree add ../SAMLprofiles.gh-pages gh-pages

- Use Asciidoctor (the preferred generator) to render the HTML and PDF versions
  of the document. Store the generated output in the gh-pages branch, like:

  asciidoctor -o ../SAMLprofiles.gh-pages/SAMLeGovImplementaton_2_0.html edit/egov-impl/main.adoc

- commit and push the change to github, e.g.:

  git commit -m 'why/what I changed' && git push

- The output will appear with a delay of a few seconds (up to a few minutes) at the github.io address
  as described above.
