Verification of metadata, if supported, MUST include XML signature verification at least at the root element level, and SHOULD support the following mechanisms for signature key trust establishment:
•	Direct comparison against known keys.
•	Some form of path-based certificate validation against one or more trusted certificate authorities, along with certificate revocation lists and/or OCSP [RFC2560]. Support for PKIX [RFC5280] is RECOMMENDED; implementations SHOULD document the behavior of the validation mechanisms they employ, particular with respect to limitations or divergence from PKIX [RFC5280].
