# SAML conformance profiles
## Objective
Modernize the SAML profiles to be used in higher education, e-Government and industry with a focus on WebSSO.
Taking the input from the InCommon Federation Interoperability WG a new profile has been created, extending existing ones:
* Kantara Initiative eGovernment Implementation Profile of SAML V2.0
* SAML2int v0.2.1 (SAML 2.0 Interoperability Deployment Profile)
The intention of this effort is to support the update of these profiles, including operation experience accumulated since the publication of above profiles, and providing more formal references to requirements, which in turn can be used by test and conformance evaluation tools.

## Contents
* SAML V2.0 Implementation Profile for Federation Interoperability [FedIopProfile]
  Draft profile to replace the Kantara eGov Implementation Profile
* Kantara eGov Implementation Profile SAML2.0 (V2.0bis)
  This document is a transformation of the document from 11 June 2011 into the Asciidoc format. The intention is to keep the essential contents, but change the format to make it comparable to the newer FedIopProfile.

Profiles that written as collections of SAML conformance requirements using RFC2119 requirements language. Each requirements has a unique id so that a profile gan be generated by referencing requirements. Conformance profiles can include or exclude a requirement. There is not provision to override any MUST/SHOULD/MAY etc. in the requirement text.
