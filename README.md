# SAML conformance profiles

This repository contains a collection of conformance requirements using RFC2119 requirements language. 
Each requirements has a unique id so that a profile gan be generated by referencing requirements. 
Conformance profiles can include or exclude a requirement. There is not provision to override any MUST/SHOULD/MAY etc. in the requiremnt text.


The requirements managed in this repository shall be the base for the next versions of the "Kantara eGovernment Implementation Profile of SAML V2.0" and the "Interoperable SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO" v0.2 deployment profiles. The core use case is WebSSO/bearer token, referencing following pieces of SAML specifications:

*	IdP Discovery
*	Binding (HTTP-Redirect Binding beim SAML AuthN-Request, HTTP-POST und HTTP-Artifact Bindings beim SAML Response)
*	Artifact Resolution Profile
*	XML Signature (signature and digest algorithms)
*	XML Encryption (block encryption, key transport & agreement algorithms)
*   All documents considering the latest SAMl Errata

Possible additions:
