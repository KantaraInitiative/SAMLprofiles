| RequID  |  IDP | SP | DS | Source    | Requirement                                                                     
| MD-100 |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | MUST support SAML V2.0 Metadata [SAML2MD] as updated by Errata [SAML2Errata]                                                                                                                                                                                                             | MD-101 |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | MUST support SAML V2.0 Metadata Schema [SAML2MD-xsd]                            
| MD-102 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/163  | MUST support the SAML V2.0 Metadata Interoperability Profile Version 1.0 [SAML2MDIOP].                                                                                                       
| MD-103 |  X   | X  | X  | InC Draft | Per [SAML2MDIOP], all run-time configuration of SAML profiles (technical trust and general operational configuration) MUST be manageable via SAML metadata alone. Further, it MUST be possible to configure an IdP or SP to allow basic interop with any peer for which metadata is supplied, without intervention by the deployer.                                                                                    
| MD-104 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/167  | MUST support the <ds:X509Certificate> element as key representation int the <md:KeyDescriptor> element                                                                                       
| MD-105 |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | Per [SAML2MDIOP], support for any number of long-lived, self-signed end entity certificates is REQUIRED, as is support for expired certificates, and certificates signed with any digest algorithm.                                                                                                       
| MD-106 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/168  | Support for other key representations than <ds:X509Certificate>, and for other mechanisms for credential distribution, is OPTIONAL                                                           
| MD-107 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/170  | MUST support some form of path validation of signing, TLS, and encryption credentials used to secure SAML exchanges against one or more trusted certificate authorities.                                                                                                                
| MD-108 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/172  | Support for PKIX [RFC5280] is RECOMMENDED. Implementations SHOULD document the behavior of the validation mechanisms they employ, particular with respect to limitations or divergence from PKIX [RFC5280]                                                                                               
| MD-109  |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/176  | MUST support the use of OCSP [RFC2560] and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) obtained via the 'CRL Distribution Point' X.509 extension [RFC5280] for revocation checking of those credentials.                                                                                                         
| MD-110  |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/179  | MAY support additional constraints on the contents of certificates used by particular entities, such as 'subjectAltName' or 'DN', key usage constraints, or policy extensions, but SHOULD document such features and make them optional to enable where possible.                                         
| MD-111  |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/186  | SHOULD support the SAML V2.0 Metadata Extension for Entity Attributes Version 1.0 [MetaAttr] and provide policy controls on the basis of SAML attributes supplied via this extension mechanism.                                                                                                           
| MD-112  |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | Key Rollover: MUST be able to consume and utilize two or more signing keys bound to a single role descriptor in metadata. To verify a signature, an implementation MUST try each signing key (in unspecified order) until the signature is verified or there are no more signing keys (in which case signature verification fails).                                                                                    
| MD-113  |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | Key Rollover: MUST be able to consume and utilize two or more encryption keys bound to a single role descriptor in metadata. To encrypt a message, any encryption key in metadata MAY be used. If there are multiple encryption keys of a given type in metadata, the implementation may choose any one of them at its discretion and need not explicitly define which one will be used.                               
| MD-114  |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | Key Rollover: If an implementation supports inbound encryption, it MUST itself be configurable with up to two decryption keys (this is not a metadata requirement but applies to the configuration of keys used by the implementation).                                                                   
| MD-115  |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | An <md:KeyDescriptor> element in metadata that contains no use XML attribute MUST be valid as either a signing or encryption key.                                               

| MD-116  |  X   |    |    | new | MUST support the grouping of SPs by Entity Categories [SAMLEntityCat] and base policy decisions on Entity Categories

| MD-117  |  X   |    |    | new | MUST support the release of a minimal attribute set based on an Entity Category value [SAMLEntityCat] in absence of <md:RequestedAttribute> elements.

| MD-118  |  X   |    |    | new | MUST support the release of an attribute set based on an Entity Category value [SAMLEntityCat] that is the intersection of the SP's <md:RequestedAttribute> elements and a set of attributes defined fo the Entity Category
