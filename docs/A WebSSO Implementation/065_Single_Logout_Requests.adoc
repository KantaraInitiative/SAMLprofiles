=== Single Logout
This section defines an implementation profile of the SAML V2.0 Single Logout Profile [SAML2Prof].
For clarification, the technical requirements for each message type below reflect the intent to normatively require initiation of logout by a Service Provider using either the front- or back-channel, and initiation/propagation of logout by an Identity Provider using the back-channel.

==== Single Logout - Functional Requirements

.Functional requirements for SAML SLO 
[width="100%", cols="4,2,2,3,30", options="header"]
|====================
| RequID  |  IDP | SP | Source    | Requirement                                                                     

| ISLO-000 |  X   |   | eGov/392  | MUST support both user-initiated termination of the local session only and user-initiated Single Logout. Upon receipt of a <saml2p:LogoutRequest> message via a front-channel binding, Identity Provider implementations MUST support user intervention governing the choice of propagating logout to other Service Providers, or limiting the operation to the Identity Provider. Of course, implementations MUST return status information to the requesting entity (e.g. partial logout indication) as appropriate.

| ISLO-001 |     | X  | eGov/399  | MUST support both user-initiated termination of the local session only and user-initiated Single Logout.

| ISLO-002 |  X  |    | eGov/399  | MUST also support the administrative initiation of Single Logout for any active session, subject to appropriate policy.
