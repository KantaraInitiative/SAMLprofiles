| RequID  |  IDP | SP | DS | Source    | Requirement                                                                     
| IMD-100 |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | MUST support SAML V2.0 Metadata [SAML2MD] as updated by Errata [SAML2Errata]                                                                                                                                                                                                             | IMD-101 |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | MUST support SAML V2.0 Metadata Schema [SAML2MD-xsd]                            

| IMD-102 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/163  | MUST support the SAML V2.0 Metadata Interoperability Profile Version 1.0 [SAML2MDIOP].                                                                                                       

| IMD-103 |  X   | X  | X  | InC Draft | Per [SAML2MDIOP], all run-time configuration of SAML profiles (technical trust and general operational configuration) MUST be manageable via SAML metadata alone. Further, it MUST be possible to configure an IdP or SP to allow basic interop with any peer for which metadata is supplied, without intervention by the deployer.                                                                                    

| IMD-104 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/167  | MUST support the <ds:X509Certificate> element as key representation int the <md:KeyDescriptor> element                                                                                       

| IMD-105 |  X   | X  |    | InC Draft | Per [SAML2MDIOP], support for any number of long-lived, self-signed end entity certificates is REQUIRED, as is support for expired certificates, and certificates signed with any digest algorithm.                                                                                                       

| IMD-106 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/168  | Support for other key representations than <ds:X509Certificate>, and for other mechanisms for credential distribution, is OPTIONAL                                                           

| IMD-107 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/170  | MUST support some form of path validation of signing, TLS, and encryption credentials used to secure SAML exchanges against one or more trusted certificate authorities.                                                                                                                

| IMD-108 |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/172  | Support for PKIX [RFC5280] is RECOMMENDED. Implementations SHOULD document the behavior of the validation mechanisms they employ, particular with respect to limitations or divergence from PKIX [RFC5280]                                                                                               

| IMD-109  |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/176  | MUST support the use of OCSP [RFC2560] and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) obtained via the 'CRL Distribution Point' X.509 extension [RFC5280] for revocation checking of those credentials.                                                                                                         

| IMD-110  |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/179  | MAY support additional constraints on the contents of certificates used by particular entities, such as 'subjectAltName' or 'DN', key usage constraints, or policy extensions, but SHOULD document such features and make them optional to enable where possible.                                         

| IMD-111  |  X   | X  | X  | eGov/186  | SHOULD support the SAML V2.0 Metadata Extension for Entity Attributes Version 1.0 [MetaAttr] and provide policy controls on the basis of SAML attributes supplied via this extension mechanism.
