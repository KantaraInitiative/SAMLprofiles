=== Changes since [eGov] from 11 June 2010

Requirements have been changed to be context free, i.e. references like "as above" have been replaced by the referenced text.

Binding and security requirements have been moved from the "Authentication Request" and "Reponse" sections of WebSSO and SLO to the "Message Flows and Bindings" heading.

Requirements IMD-100, IMD-103 and IMD-105 have been implicit in [eGov], but added for clarification in this part to improve the sequence of requirements.

The section "HolderOfKey" has been excluded .

Cryptographic requirements already dated and have been moved into a separate document.

Section "Conformance Classes" has been excluded.
