== Differences to eGovernment Implementation Profile of SAML V2.0
This document supercedes the older link:eGovImplProfile.html[eGovernment Implementation Profile V2.0bis].
This section summarizes the differences between the two profiles.

The profiles will be abbreviated "Interop" and "eGov" respectively.

== General Changes in the Interop Profile
- The name reflects the fact that SAML WebSSO Federation as described in the eGov profile is in fact applicable to any sector, not only to public sector.
- The profile specifies the minimal requirements for implementers of SAML software that that promote interoperability by default.
- Requirements have been reworded in the Interop profile for better precision and to reflect lessons learned.
- Requirements have been selected to be testable and related to the implementation perspective.

=== Approach to Mapping the Profiles
- The Interop Profile introduces a new layer in its outline for requirements that are related to IDPs, SPs or are common to both. The mapping table follows the eGov strucuture.
- The conformance classes have been dropped in favor of a single set of requirements.
- The June 2010 version 2.0 of the eGov profile was reformatted in a more formal way with requirement identifiers for better reference, and is published as version 2.0bis. The following mapping table is using these identifiers.
- This section is not going into the fine details, but tries to give a guide to the changes in general. Only MUST and SHOULD requirements have not been included.
