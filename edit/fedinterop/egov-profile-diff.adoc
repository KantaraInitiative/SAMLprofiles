== Differences to eGovernment Implementation Profile of SAML V2.0
The Implementation Profile for Federation Interoperability shall replace the older
eGov profile, which was not limited in its application to government agencies.
This section provides an overview of the differences between the two profiles.
The profiles will be abbreviated "Interop profile" and "eGov profile" respectively.

=== Structure and General Approach
- The InteropProfile introduces a new layer in its outline for requirements that are
related to IDPs, SPs or are common.
- The conformance classes have been dropped in favor of a single set or requirements.
- Requirements were scrutinized to be testable and related to the implementation level.

=== Requirement Mapping
The June 2010 version of the eGov profile was reformatted in a more formal way
with a requirement identifiers for better reference as version 2.0bis. The following
mapping table is using these identifiers.
Requirements have been reworded in the Interop profile for better precision and to
reflect lessons learned. This section is not going into the fine details, but tries
to give a guide to the changes in general. Differences in optional ('MAY') requirements
have not been listed.
