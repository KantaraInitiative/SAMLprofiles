=== Cryptographic Algorithms

[IIP-ALG01]:: Implementations MUST support the digest algorithms identified by the following URIs in conjunction with the creation and verification of XML Signatures <<XMLSig>>:

* ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256``` <<XMLEnc>>

[IIP-ALG02]:: Implementations MUST support the signature algorithms identified by the following URIs in conjunction with the creation and verification of XML Signatures <<XMLSig>>:

* ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256``` <<RFC4051>>

[IIP-ALG03]:: Implementations SHOULD support the signature algorithms identified by the following URIs in conjunction with the creation and verification of XML Signatures <<XMLSig>>:

* ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#ecdsa-sha256``` <<RFC4051>>

[IIP-ALG04]:: Implementations MUST support the block encryption algorithms identified by the following URIs in conjunction with the use of XML Encryption <<XMLEnc>>:

* ```http://www.w3.org/2009/xmlenc11#aes128-gcm``` <<XMLEnc>>
* ```http://www.w3.org/2009/xmlenc11#aes256-gcm``` <<XMLEnc>>

[IIP-ALG05]:: Implementations MAY support the block encryption algorithms identified by the following URIs in conjunction with the use of XML Encryption <<XMLEnc>> for backwards compatibility:

* ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes128-cbc``` <<XMLEnc>>
* ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes256-cbc``` <<XMLEnc>>

The use of these algorithms is widespread at the time of authoring, but is known to be broken <<XMLEncBreak>> and should be avoided in new applications. Implementations supporting them SHOULD warn on use.

[IIP-ALG06]:: Implementations MUST support the key transport algorithms identified by the following URIs in conjunction with the use of XML Encryption <<XMLEnc>>:

* ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-oaep-mgf1p``` <<XMLEnc>>
* ```http://www.w3.org/2009/xmlenc11#rsa-oaep``` <<XMLEnc>>

The following DigestMethod algorithms MUST be supported for both of the above key transport algorithms:

* ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256```

The following DigestMethod algorithms SHOULD be supported for both of the above key transport algorithms for backward compatibility.

* ```http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1```

The default mask generation function (MGF1 with SHA1) MUST be supported for the KeyTransport algorithm identified by ```http://www.w3.org/2009/xmlenc11#rsa-oaep```.

[IIP-ALG07]:: This document is not normative with respect to TLS security. It is, however, RECOMMENDED that implementers consider <<RFC7457>> and current best practice reflected in documents such as <<BetterCrypto>>.

[IIP-ALG08]:: Implementations MUST support the ability to prevent the use of particular algorithms such that any attempt to configure or select them will result in failure. The set of such algorithms MUST be configurable and it is RECOMMENDED that the default set include:

* Digest
** ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#md5``` <<RFC4051>>

* Signature
** ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-md5``` <<RFC4051>>

* Key Transport
** ```http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-1_5``` <<XMLEnc>>
