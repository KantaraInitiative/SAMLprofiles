=== Attribute Name Formats

In conjunction with their support of the SAML V2.0 profiles referenced by subsequent sections, Identity Provider and Service Provider implementations MUST support the generation and consumption of <saml2:Attribute> elements that conform to the SAML V2.0 X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile [SAML-X500].
The ability to support <saml2:AttributeValue> elements whose values are not simple strings (e.g., <saml2:NameID>, or other XML values) is OPTIONAL. Such content could be base64-encoded as an alternative.
