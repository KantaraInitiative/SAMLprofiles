=== Single Logout
This section defines an implementation profile of the SAML V2.0 Single Logout Profile <<SAML2Prof>>.
For clarification, the technical requirements for each message type below reflect the intent to normatively require initiation of logout by a Service Provider using either the front- or back-channel, and initiation/propagation of logout by an Identity Provider using the back-channel.
