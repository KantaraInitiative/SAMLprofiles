| RequID   | IDP  | SP   | Line | Requirement
| eGov-041 |      | MUST | 247  | Support the inclusion of at least the following <saml2p:AuthnRequest> child elements and attributes (when appropriate).

* AssertionConsumerServiceURL
* ProtocolBinding
* ForceAuthn
* IsPassive
* AttributeConsumingServiceIndex
* <saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>
* <saml2p:NameIDPolicy>

| eGov-042 | MUST |  | 257 | Support all <saml2p:AuthnRequest> child elements and attributes defined by <<SAML2Core>>, but MAY provide that support in the form of returning appropriate errors when confronted by particular request options.
| eGov-043 | MUST |  | 262 | MUST support any allowable content of the <saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext> element but MAY limit their support of the element to the value "exact" for the Comparison attribute.
| eGov-044 | MUST |  | 260 | MUST fully support the options enumerated in [eGov-041], and be configurable to utilize those options in a useful manner as defined by <<SAML2Core>>.
| eGov-045 | MUST |  | 266 | MUST support verification of requested AssertionConsumerServiceURL locations via comparison to <md:AssertionConsumerService> elements supplied via metadata using case-sensitive string comparison. It is OPTIONAL to support other means of comparison (e.g., canonicalization or other manipulation of URL values) or alternative verification mechanisms.

==== Responses

|====================
| RequID   | IDP  | SP   | Line  | Requirement
| eGov-050 | MUST | MUST | 274   | Support the use of the HTTP-POST and HTTP-Artifact bindings [SAML2Bind] for the transmission of <saml2p:Response> messages.
| eGov-051 | MAY  | MAY  | 277   | Support for other bindings, and for artifact types other than urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:artifact-04
| eGov-052 | MUST | MUST | 279   | Support the generation and consumption of unsolicited <saml2p:Response> messages (i.e., responses that are not the result of a <saml2p:AuthnRequest> message). (see <<SAML2Prof>> sect. 4.1.5)
| eGov-053 | MUST |      | 282   | Support the issuance of <saml2p:Response> messages (with appropriate status codes) in the event of an error condition, provided that the user agent remains available and an acceptable location to which to deliver the response is available. The criteria for "acceptability" of a response location are not formally specified, but are subject to Identity Provider policy and reflect its responsibility to protect users from being sent to untrusted or possibly malicious parties. Note that this is a stronger requirement than the comparable language in [SAML2Prof].
| eGov-054 | MUST | MUST | 290   | Support the signing of <saml2:Assertion> elements in responses; support for signing of the <saml2p:Response> element is OPTIONAL.
| eGov-055 | MUST | MUST | 293   | Support the use of XML Encryption via the <saml2:EncryptedAssertion> element when using the HTTP-POST binding; support for the <saml2:EncryptedID> and <saml2:EncryptedAttribute> elements is OPTIONAL.
