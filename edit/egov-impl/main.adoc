.Abstract
This document contains an implementation profile for eGovernment use of SAML V2.0, suitable for the purposes of testing conformance of implementations of SAML V2.0. It is not a deployment profile, and does not provide for or reflect specific behavior expected of implementations when used within a particular deployment context.

.Status
This document is a transformation of the document from 11 June 2011 into the Asciidoc format.
While keeping the requirements as-is, the goal was to change the format to establish a more formally
structured baseline for a comparison with the successor of this profile.
