=== SAML 2.0 Proxying

Section 3.4.1.5 of <<SAML2Core>> defines a formalized approach to proxying the SAML 2.0 Authentication Request protocol between multiple Identity Providers. This section defines an implementation profile for this behavior suitable for composition with the Single Sign-On profiles defined in sections 2.5 and 2.6.
The requirements of the profile are imposed on Identity Provider implementations acting as a proxy.

| RequID  | IDP  | SP   | Source| Format Identifier                                                                  
| ISPR-001 | MUST | MUST | eGov/350| (If acting as a proxy) MUST support the technical requirements outlined in section 3.4.1.5.1 of <<SAML2Core>>
| ISPR-002 | MUST | MUST | eGov/350| (When processing Authentication Requests) MUST support the mapping of incoming to outgoing `<saml2p:RequestedAuthnContext>` and `<saml2p:NameIDPolicy>` elements, such that deployers may choose to pass through values or map between different vocabularies as required.
| ISPR-003 | MUST | MUST | eGov/354| (When processing Authentication Requests) MUST support the suppression/eliding of `<saml2p:RequesterID>` elements from outgoing `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages to allow for hiding the identity of the Service Provider from proxied Identity Providers.
| ISPR-004 | MUST | MUST | eGov/359| (When processing WebSSO Response) MUST support the mapping of incoming to outgoing `<saml2:AuthnContext>` elements, such that deployers may choose to pass through values or map between different vocabularies as required.
| ISPR-005 | MUST | MUST | eGov/362| (When processing WebSSO Response) MUST support the suppression of `<saml2:AuthenticatingAuthority>` elements from outgoing `<saml2:AuthnContext>` elements to allow for hiding the identity of the proxied Identity Provider from Service Providers.
