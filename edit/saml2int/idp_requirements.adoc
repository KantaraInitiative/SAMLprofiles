== IdP Requirements

=== Web Browser SSO

[SDP-IDP01]:: IdPs MUST support the Browser SSO Profile <<SAML2Prof>>, as updated by the Approved Errata <<SAML2Err>>, with behavior, capabilities, and options consistent with the additional constraints specified in this section.

==== Requests

===== Binding

[SDP-IDP02]:: IdPs MUST support the HTTP-Redirect binding <<SAML2Bind>> for the receipt of `<samlp:AuthnRequest>` messages.

[SDP-IDP03]:: The endpoint(s) at which an IdP supports receipt of `<samlp:AuthnRequest>` messages MUST be protected by TLS/SSL.

===== Endpoint Verification

[SDP-IDP04]:: When verifying the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL`, it is RECOMMENDED that the IdP perform a case-sensitive string comparison between the requested value and the values found in the SP's metadata. It is OPTIONAL to apply any form of URL canonicalization.

===== Signing

[SDP-IDP05]:: If a request is signed, IdPs MUST verify the signature or fail the request. An IdP MAY handle a signature verification failure locally rather than via an error response to the SP.

[SDP-IDP06]:: IdPs MUST reject unsigned requests in the event that an SP's metadata includes an `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute set to `true` or `1`.

===== Forced Re-Authentication

[SDP-IDP07]:: IdPs MUST ensure that any response to a `<samlp:AuthnRequest>` that contains the attribute `ForceAuthn` set to `true` or `1` results in an authentication challenge that requires proof that the subject is present. If this condition is met, the IdP MUST also reflect this by setting the value of the `AuthnInstant` value in the assertion it returns to a fresh value.

If an IdP cannot prove subject presence, then it MUST fail the request and SHOULD respond to the SP with a SAML error status.

==== Responses

===== Binding

[SDP-IDP08]:: IdPs MUST support the HTTP-POST binding <<SAML2Bind>> for the transmission of `<samlp:Response>` messages.

===== Response Content

[SDP-IDP09]:: Successful responses MUST be directly signed using a `<ds:Signature>` element within the `<samlp:Response>` element.  Error responses MAY be signed.

[SDP-IDP11]:: Successful responses MUST contain one and only one SAML assertion, and the assertion MUST contain exactly one `<saml:AuthnStatement>` element and MAY contain zero or one `<saml:AttributeStatement>` elements. The assertion within the response MAY be directly signed.

[SDP-IDP12]:: In the event the HTTP-POST binding <<SAML2Bind>> is used, assertions MUST be encrypted and transmitted via a `<saml:EncryptedAssertion>` element. Information intended for the consumption of the SP MUST NOT be further encrypted via `<saml:EncryptedID>` or `<saml:EncryptedAttribute>` constructs.

==== Subject Identifiers

[SDP-IDP13]:: Assertions MUST contain a `<saml:NameID>` element with the `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient` Format, as defined in <<SAML2Core>>, for the purposes of logout.

[SDP-IDP14]:: IdPs MUST support one or both of the SAML Attributes defined by <<SAML2SubjId>> for non-transient identification of subjects. Support for both is RECOMMENDED.

===== Subject Identifier Requirements Signaling

[SDP-IDP15]:: IdPs MUST support the metadata-based identifier requirement signaling mechanism defined in <<SAML2SubjId>>.

[SDP-IDP16]:: If an IdP cannot or will not satisfy the requirements of an SP in this respect, then it MUST fail the authentication request and SHOULD respond to the SP with a SAML error status.

[SDP-IDP17]:: In the absence of any signaling by an SP, an IdP MAY supply either, both, or neither SAML Attribute, or return an error as it sees fit.

==== Attributes

[SDP-IDP18]:: `<saml:Attribute>` elements MUST contain a NameFormat of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri`.

_This requirement ensures unique, non-conflicting naming of Attributes even in cases involving custom requirements for which no standard Attributes may exist._

[SDP-IDP19]:: It is RECOMMENDED that the content of `<saml:AttributeValue>` elements be limited to a single child text node (i.e., a simple string value).

=== Single Logout

[SDP-IDP20]:: IdPs MUST support the Single Logout Profile <<SAML2Prof>>, as updated by the Approved Errata <<SAML2Err>>, with behavior, capabilities, and options consistent with the additional constraints specified in this section.

_The term "IdP session" is used to refer to the ongoing state between the IdP and its clients allowing for SSO. Support for logout implies supporting termination of a subject's IdP session in response to receiving a `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` or upon some administrative signal._

[SDP-IDP21]:: IdPs MAY allow a subject the option to maintain their IdP session rather than unilaterally terminating it.

[SDP-IDP22]:: IdPs MAY support the propagation of logout signaling to SPs.

==== Requests

===== Binding

[SDP-IDP23]:: The HTTP-Redirect binding [SAML2Bind] MUST be used for the transmission of `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages, in the event that propagation is supported.

[SDP-IDP24]:: IdPs MUST support the HTTP-Redirect [SAML2Bind] binding for the receipt of `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages.

==== Request Content

[SDP-IDP25]:: Requests MUST be signed.

[SDP-IDP26]:: The `<saml:NameID>` element in `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages MUST NOT be encrypted.

_The normative requirement for the use of transient identifiers is intended to obviate the need for XML Encryption._

==== Responses

===== Binding

[SDP-IDP27]:: The HTTP-Redirect binding [SAML2Bind] MUST be used for the transmission of `<samlp:LogoutResponse>` messages.

[SDP-IDP28]:: IdPs MUST support the HTTP-Redirect [SAML2Bind] binding for the receipt of `<samlp:LogoutResponse>` messages, in the event that `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` propagation is supported.

===== Response Content

[SDP-IDP29]:: Responses MUST be signed.

[SDP-IDP30]:: The `<samlp:StatusCode>` in the response issued by the IdP MUST reflect whether the IdP session was successfully terminated.

=== Metadata and Trust Management

==== Support for Multiple Keys

The ability to perform seamless key migration depends upon proper support for consuming and/or leveraging multiple keys at the same time.

[SDP-IDP30]:: IdP deployments MUST support multiple signing certificates in SP metadata and MUST support validation of signatures using a key from any of them.

==== Metadata Content

[SDP-IDP31]:: By virtue of this profile's requirements, an IdP's metadata MUST contain:

* an `<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` role element containing an `errorURL` attribute and an appropriate URL value
** at least one `<md:SingleSignOnService>` endpoint element
** at least one `<md:SingleLogoutService>` endpoint element
** at least one `<md:KeyDescriptor>` element whose `use` attribute is omitted or set to `signing`
* an `<md:Extensions>` element
** an `<mdui:UIInfo>` extension element with previously prescribed content

In addition, an IdP's metadata MUST contain:

* an `<md:ContactPerson>` element with a `contactType` of `technical` and an `<md:EmailAddress>` element
