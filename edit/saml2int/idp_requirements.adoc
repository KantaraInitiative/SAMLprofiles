== Identity Provider Requirements

This section provides requirements specific to IdPs, in addition to the Common Requirements above.

=== Web Browser SSO

[SDP-IDP01]:: IdPs MUST support the Browser SSO Profile <<SAML2Prof>>, as updated by the Approved Errata <<SAML2Err>>, with behavior, capabilities, and options consistent with the additional constraints specified in this section.

==== Requests

===== Binding

[SDP-IDP02]:: IdPs MUST support the HTTP-Redirect binding <<SAML2Bind>> for the receipt of `<samlp:AuthnRequest>` messages.

[SDP-IDP03]:: The endpoint(s) at which an IdP supports receipt of `<samlp:AuthnRequest>` messages MUST be protected by TLS/SSL.

===== Signing

[SDP-IDP04]:: IdPs MUST support unsigned requests generally but MUST reject unsigned requests in the event that an SP's metadata includes an `AuthnRequestsSigned` attribute set to `true` or `1`.

[SDP-IDP05]:: If a request is signed, IdPs MUST successfully verify the signature or fail the request. An IdP MAY handle a signature verification failure locally rather than via an error response to the SP.

===== Endpoint Selection/Verification

[SDP-IDP06]:: IdPs MUST verify the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` supplied in an SP's `<samlp:AuthnRequest>` (if any) against the `<md:AssertionConsumerService>` elements in the SP's metadata. In the absence of such a value, the default endpoint from the SP's metadata MUST be used for the response.

When verifying the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL`, it is RECOMMENDED that the IdP perform a case-sensitive string comparison between the requested value and the values found in the SP's metadata. It is OPTIONAL to apply any form of URL canonicalization.

_The Browser SSO Profile <<SAML2Prof>> notes that validation of the response endpoint is required but does not mandate a specific approach, primarily due to metadata being an optional portion of the original standard. The above is the most common and interoperable approach to meeting this requirement._

===== Forced Re-Authentication

[SDP-IDP07]:: IdPs MUST ensure that any response to a `<samlp:AuthnRequest>` that contains the attribute `ForceAuthn` set to `true` or `1` results in an authentication challenge that requires proof that the subject is present. If this condition is met, the IdP MUST also reflect this by setting the value of the `AuthnInstant` value in the assertion it returns to a fresh value.

If an IdP cannot prove subject presence, then it MUST fail the request and SHOULD respond to the SP with a SAML error status.

==== Responses

===== Binding

[SDP-IDP08]:: IdPs MUST support the HTTP-POST binding <<SAML2Bind>> for the transmission of `<samlp:Response>` messages.

===== Response Content

[SDP-IDP09]:: Successful responses MUST be directly signed using a `<ds:Signature>` element within the `<samlp:Response>` element. Error responses MAY be unsigned.

[SDP-IDP10]:: Successful responses MUST contain exactly one SAML assertion. The assertion MUST contain exactly one `<saml:AuthnStatement>` element and MUST contain zero or one `<saml:AttributeStatement>` elements. The assertion within the response MAY be directly signed.

[SDP-IDP11]:: In the event the HTTP-POST binding <<SAML2Bind>> is used, assertions MUST be encrypted and transmitted via a `<saml:EncryptedAssertion>` element. Information intended for the consumption of the SP MUST NOT be further encrypted via `<saml:EncryptedID>` or `<saml:EncryptedAttribute>` constructs.

_While encryption is viewed in some quarters as onerous or unnecessary, interoperability is enhanced by uniformity. Moreover, a spate of recent vulnerabilities across the industry would have been almost entirely mitigated by its use, demonstrating that it is no longer acceptable to view it as an optional part of front-channel delivery of assertions, if it ever was._

==== Subject Identifiers

[SDP-IDP12]:: Assertions MUST contain a `<saml:NameID>` element with the `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient` Format, as defined in <<SAML2Core>>, for the purposes of logout.

[SDP-IDP13]:: IdPs MUST support one or both of the SAML Attributes defined by <<SAML2SubjId>> for non-transient identification of subjects. Support for both is RECOMMENDED.

[SDP-IDP14]:: IdPs MUST enumerate the scope(s) of the subject identifiers they support in their metadata by means of the `<shibmd:Scope>` extension element, as defined in <<SAML2SubjId>>. They MUST NOT contain a regular expression (i.e., each element's `regexp` attribute MUST be set to `false` or `0`).

The element(s) may be positioned as an extension of either the `<md:EntityDescriptor>` or `<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` as deemed appropriate.

_Note that while common, it is not a requirement for the scope(s) to be contained within the IdP's entityID, nor for it to bear any relationship to other data asserted by the IdP, such as email addresses._

===== Subject Identifier Requirements Signaling

[SDP-IDP15]:: IdPs MUST support the metadata-based identifier requirement signaling mechanism defined in <<SAML2SubjId>>.

_The purpose of this requirement is to provide a level of confidence to a signaling SP that a compliant IdP which fails to do as instructed is unwilling or unable to fulfill the requirements rather than merely oblivious to them._ 

[SDP-IDP16]:: If an IdP cannot or will not satisfy the requirements of an SP in this respect, then it MAY return an assertion without the data it is unable to provide or return an error as it sees fit. 

[SDP-IDP17]:: In the absence of any signaling by an SP, an IdP MAY supply either, both, or neither of the SAML Attributes defined in <<SAML2SubjId>>, or return an error as it sees fit.

==== Attributes

[SDP-IDP18]:: `<saml:Attribute>` elements MUST contain a NameFormat of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri`.

_This requirement ensures unique, non-conflicting naming of SAML Attributes even in cases involving custom requirements for which no standard SAML Attributes may exist._

[SDP-IDP19]:: It is RECOMMENDED that the content of each `<saml:AttributeValue>` element be limited to a single child text node (i.e., a simple string value).

_Note that this refers to `<saml:AttributeValue>` elements, not `<saml:Attribute>` elements, and refers to the form of each individual value. It discourages the use of complex XML content models within the value of a SAML Attribute._

[SDP-IDP20]:: Multiple values of a `<saml:Attribute>` MUST be expressed as individual `<saml:AttributeValue>` elements rather than embedded in a delimited form within a single `<saml:AttributeValue>` element.

=== Single Logout

[SDP-IDP21]:: IdPs MUST support the Single Logout Profile <<SAML2Prof>>, as updated by the Approved Errata <<SAML2Err>>, with behavior, capabilities, and options consistent with the additional constraints specified in this section.

_The term "IdP session" is used to refer to the ongoing state between the IdP and its clients allowing for SSO. Support for logout implies supporting termination of a subject's IdP session in response to receiving a `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` or upon some administrative signal._

[SDP-IDP22]:: IdPs MAY allow a subject the option to maintain their IdP session rather than unilaterally terminating it.

[SDP-IDP23]:: IdPs MAY support the propagation of logout signaling to SPs.

==== Requests

===== Binding

[SDP-IDP24]:: The HTTP-Redirect binding [SAML2Bind] MUST be used for the transmission of `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages, in the event that propagation is supported.

[SDP-IDP25]:: IdPs MUST support the HTTP-Redirect [SAML2Bind] binding for the receipt of `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages.

==== Request Content

[SDP-IDP26]:: Requests MUST be signed (via a signature created in accordance with the HTTP-Redirect binding [SAML2Bind]).

[SDP-IDP27]:: The `<saml:NameID>` element in `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages MUST NOT be encrypted.

_The normative requirement for the use of transient identifiers is intended to obviate the need for XML Encryption._

==== Responses

===== Binding

[SDP-IDP28]:: The HTTP-Redirect binding [SAML2Bind] MUST be used for the transmission of `<samlp:LogoutResponse>` messages.

[SDP-IDP29]:: IdPs MUST support the HTTP-Redirect [SAML2Bind] binding for the receipt of `<samlp:LogoutResponse>` messages, in the event that `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` propagation is supported.

===== Response Content

[SDP-IDP30]:: Responses MUST be signed (via a signature created in accordance with the HTTP-Redirect binding [SAML2Bind]).

[SDP-IDP31]:: The `<samlp:StatusCode>` in the response issued by the IdP MUST reflect whether the IdP session was successfully terminated.

=== Metadata and Trust Management

==== Support for Multiple Keys

The ability to perform seamless key migration depends upon proper support for consuming and/or leveraging multiple keys at the same time.

[SDP-IDP32]:: IdP deployments MUST support multiple signing certificates in SP metadata and MUST support validation of signatures using a key from any of them.

==== Metadata Content

[SDP-IDP33]:: By virtue of this profile's requirements, an IdP's metadata MUST contain:

* an `<md:IDPSSODescriptor>` role element containing
** at least one `<md:SingleSignOnService>` endpoint element
** at least one `<md:SingleLogoutService>` endpoint element
** at least one `<md:KeyDescriptor>` element whose `use` attribute is omitted or set to `signing`
** an `<md:ContactPerson>` element with a `contactType` of `technical` and an `<md:EmailAddress>` element
** an `errorURL` attribute

* an `<md:Extensions>` element at the role level containing
** an `<mdui:UIInfo>` extension element containing the child elements `<mdui:DisplayName>` and `<mdui:Logo>`
** at least one `<shibmd:Scope>` element 
*** alternately, the `<shibmd:Scope>` element(s) MAY instead reside in an `<md:Extensions>` element at the root (`<md:EntityDescriptor>`) level
