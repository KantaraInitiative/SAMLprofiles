=== Terminology

The abbreviations IdP and SP are used below to refer to Identity Providers and Service Providers in the sense of their usage within the SAML Browser SSO Profile and Single Logout profiles.

Whether explicit or implicit, all the requirements in this document are meant to apply to deployments of SAML profiles and may involve explicit support for requirements by SAML-implementing software and/or supplemental support via application code. Deployments of a Service Provider may refer to both stand-alone implementations of SAML, libraries integrated with an application, or any combination of the two. It is difficult to define a clear boundary between a Service Provider and the application/service it represents, and unnecessary to do so for the purposes of this document.
