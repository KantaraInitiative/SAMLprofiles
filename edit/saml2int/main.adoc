.Abstract
This profile specifies behavior and options that deployments of the SAML V2.0 Web Browser SSO profile <<SAML2Prof>>, and related profiles, are required or permitted to rely on. This deployment profile should not be confused with a SAML implementation profile, such as <<SAML2Impl>>. A deployment profile specifies how software should be configured given a specific set of deployment goals. An implementation profile tells software developers how they must implement their software in order to meet basic requirements.
