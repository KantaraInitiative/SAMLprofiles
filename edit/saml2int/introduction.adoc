== Introduction

This profile specifies behavior and options that deployments of the SAML V2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile <<SAML2Prof>> are required or permitted to rely on. The requirements specified are in addition to all normative requirements of the original profile, as modified by the Approved Errata <<SAML2Err>>, and readers should be familiar with all relevant reference documents. Any such requirements are not repeated here except where deemed necessary to highlight a point of discussion or draw attention to an issue addressed in errata, but remain implied.

This profile addresses the content, exchange, and processing of SAML messages only, and does not address deployment details that go beyond that scope. Furthermore, nothing in the profile should be taken to imply that disclosing personally identifiable information, or indeed any information, is required from an Identity Provider with respect to any particular Service Provider. That remains at the discretion of applicable settings, user consent, or other appropriate means in accordance with regulations and policies. However, this profile does obligate Identity Providers to honor certain key signals from a Service Provider in the area of subject identification and requires successful responses to include specific SAML Attributes under certain conditions. Failure is always an option.

Note that SAML features that are optional, or lack mandatory processing rules, are assumed to be optional and out of scope of this profile if not otherwise precluded or given specific processing rules.
